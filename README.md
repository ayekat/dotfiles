dotfiles README
===============

This is my personal collection of my dotfiles and scripts that are used to make
certain configurations work.

Nothing more.


usage
-----

I usually symlink my dotfiles to the versions in the git directory.


handle with care!
-----------------

The scripts are meant to work interconnected in myriad ways, so I highly
recommend to check a script before considering using it. And even then, it's
likely that they are broken - and/or break other things.

Because it's what I do: I break things.

On a daily basis.
