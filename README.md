ayekat/dotfiles README
======================

This is a collection of (maybe) useful dotfiles.

Nothing more.


usage
-----

I usually symlink my dotfiles to the versions in the git directory.


warning!
--------

These dotfiles were previously stored in a private git repository somewhere else
than github. After removing sensible information (irssi config with password,
pr0n download scripts, phone number of your mom, ...), I thought I'd upload it
to github to make them accessible for the rest of the Internetz.

HANDLE WITH CARE!
The scripts are meant to work interconnected in myriad ways, so I highly
recommend to check a script before considering using it. And even then, it's
likely that they are broken.

And/or break other things.

Because it's what I do: I break things on a daily basis.

---

On the other hand, if you are seriously considering using the whole set of
scripts, they may need some packages to work correctly; check out
http://ayekat.ch/dada/packages.php for a list of packages that are supposed to
exist on the system.
