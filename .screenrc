hardstatus alwayslastline "%{= kc}[%c:%s] %{= kg}%-w%{=r}%n %t%{-}%+w"

# Explanation:
# * First, we set the background color to black ("k") and the foreground color
#   to cyan ("c"). This is achieved inside the "{}"-braces, after the "=".
#   Next, the time is displayed with the variables %c (HH:MM) and %s (SS).
# * To display the window list, we choose for example a yellow color on black
#   background, therefore "%{= ky}".
#   As we want to handle the current window specially, we only show the windows
#   that come before ("%-w") and after ("%+w") the current window with the
#   settings above.
# * To display the current window, we switch the colors with "r" inside the
#   "{}"-braces.
#   With these settings we display the number ("%n") and the title ("%t") of the
#   current window.
# * Don't forget to display the rest of the window list with "%+w"; to set the
#   color back to the former settings, just use "%{-}".
