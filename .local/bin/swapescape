# On-the-fly keyboard remappings. This is for machines where you have no root
# permission (for example for the machines at the EPFL).

# swap Escape and CapsLock:
xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 9 = Caps_Lock'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Escape'
xmodmap -e 'add Lock = Caps_Lock'

# more ergonomic Backspace/Delete (doesn't work on EPFL machines):
xmodmap -e 'keycode 44 = j J BackSpace BackSpace'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 45 = k K Delete Delete'
