# This file takes a java JAR file name as an argument and runs it if it's
# located in the 'jars' directory.
# Written by ayekat on a stressed sunday afternoon in october 2013.

# first argument = JAR file name:
jarfile=$1
jarpath="$(dirname $0)"/jars/"$jarfile"
shift

# check if JAR file exits:
if [ ! -f "$jarpath" ]; then
	printf "could not find corresponding jarfile %s in %s\n" \
			"$jarfile" "$(dirname "$jarpath")" >&2
	exit 1
fi

# execute with the remainder of arguments passed to the JAR file:
java -jar "$jarpath" "$@"
