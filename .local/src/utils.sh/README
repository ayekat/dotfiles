NAME
	utils.sh - shell utilities

DESCRIPTION
	utils.sh is a POSIX-compliant shell snippet that contains handy little
	functions for writing medium-sized shell scripts.

USAGE
	At the beginning of your script, include this line:

		. /usr/local/include/utils.sh
	
	(or where ever you installed utils.sh to).

	Read the script for information about what can be done (it doesn't contain
	thorough commenting yet, but it's fairly short).
