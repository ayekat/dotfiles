NAME
	open - open files with a default programme according to its MIME type

SYNOPSIS
	open [file [...]]

DESCRIPTION
	Detects the MIME type of a file, looks up the user's configurations to
	determine which programme is to be executed to open the file, and forks. If
	the MIME type is not specified in the user's configuration, the open utility
	quits with a non-zero return value.

	Each argument is treated separately, so

		open wallpaper.png /etc

	is equal to

		open wallpaper.png; open /etc
	
	and will open wallpaper.png with the application associated to image/png and
	/etc to the application associated to inode/directory.

	Passing no argument is equal to 'open .'

FILES
	${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/open/mapping
		Contains the mapping from each MIME-type to a shell commandline. Note
		that the value to the right will be evaluated by /bin/sh, so you may
		also specify multiple commands on the same line.
		
		The file given as argument will either substitute the placeholder
		sequence, or be appended to the commandline if no such placeholder
		exists. The placeholder sequence is defined by the 'placeholder'
		mapping.

		If the file does not exist, it is created with an empty configuration;
		invoke open once after the installation to create the file.

		If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, open will default to ~/.config.

NOTE
	You may most likely be interested in using a file manager to do the
	MIME-to-default-application mapping, as it uses Desktop files as understood
	by most graphical environments and defined by freedesktop.org; the open
	utility is not very portable.

	open was written to provide a default-application handling without the need
	for having a full graphical file manager, or any compatibility with its
	standards.

EXIT STATUS
	If there exists no mapping to one of the files passed, open return 1,
	otherwise the return value is 0.
