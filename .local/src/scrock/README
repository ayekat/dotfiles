NAME
	scrock - lock screen with user-defined backend

SYNOPSIS
	scrock [option]

DESCRIPTION
	Locks the X screen with a provided backend application (slock, xtrlock,
	xscreensaver, ...), and performs a few additional actions.

	-h, --help
		display help

	--create-config
		create new sample config in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scrock

	-d, --daemon start|stop
		start or stop an xautolock process; it may be regarded as a "daemon"
		that locks the screen after a timeout as specified in the configuration
		file

CONFIGURATION
	scrock searches a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scrock.
	Configuration variables are listed below. The only mandatory variable is
	$SCROCK_CMD; if missing, scrock will abort and return an error. If the file
	is missing, scrock will create a sample configuration file containing all
	variables and short descriptions for them, and exit with an error status.

	$SCROCK_CMD
		The full command line to be executed. Please try not to fork the backend
		application, unless you know what you are doing.
	
	$SCROCK_PID
		The file where the PID of the currently running screen lock instance
		will be stored. This prevents multiple scrock instances from running
		simultaneously.
	
	$SCROCK_DUNST
		If set to 1, scrock will disable dunst while the screen lock programme
		is running, in order to avoid flickering (and CPU usage); if set to 0,
		no additional actions are taken.
	
	$SCROCK_IDLE
		Time until the screen gets locked automatically (with the --daemon
		option). Requires xautolock to be installed on the system.

	As you may have guessed, the configuration file is simply a shell script
	snippet that will be sourced by scrock at the beginnning of its execution.

EXIT STATUS
	If successful, scrock returns 0. Otherwise, the following return values are
	possible:

	 1: Configuration file is missing and thus created.
	 2: A scrock instance is already running.
	 4: Missing $SCROCK_CMD.
	 8: Errors in command line.
	16: Errors related to xautolock.

BUGS
	In rare occasions the whole mechanism around dunst crashes and makes the CPU
	go up to 100%. This should only happen after disabling the screensaver and
	reenabling dunst. In that case simply kill dunst.
